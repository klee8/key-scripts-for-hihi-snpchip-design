This set of scripts were used in the design of the hihi snpchip. 

divide_into_equal_regions.pl was used to divide bam files into regions of equal length to parallelise GATK re-alignment

vcf_annotate.pl was used to add information to the end of the vcf files

blastparse.pl was used to interrogate BLAST information for SNP positions and gene information

vcf.pos.ann.pl was used to integrate BLAST information into the vcf files

filter_read_depth.pl was used to do an initial pass of read depth filtering on vcfs

setup_split_vcfs.sh was used to set up an awk script to split vcf files by zebra finch chromosome (added during positional annotation)

merge_filter.pl was used to merge the SNP information from different assemblies using the zebra finch position information

get_snps_fasta.pl was used to get the fasta sequences flanking filtered SNPs
